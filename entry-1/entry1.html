                <h4><strong>When Boston fell head-over-heels in love with Claude Monet</strong></h4>
                <img class="thin-border" id="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Monet_-_Monets_Garten_in_Giverny.jpg" 
                alt=:"Le Jardin de l'artiste à Giverny, 1900 by Claude Monet">
                <p>Claude Monet never made it to Boston, but some of the city’s collectors were determined <mark>to make his acquaintance</mark>, even sailing to France to visit his home in Giverny and <mark>scoop up</mark> a painting or two.</p>
                <p>In an 1891 letter, the American painter John Singer Sargent, <mark>a denizen</mark> of Giverny, <mark>writes of encountering</mark> such collectors at Monet’s home. “We came away from you full of enthusiasm despite the Bostonian air of those ladies,” he wrote. “Mrs Fairchild must have written to her husband to make him take two of them, one from [the Paris gallery] Durand-Ruel and another from you.” Sargent <mark>acted as a go-between</mark>, <mark>clinching</mark> the purchase from Durand-Ruel.</p>
                <p><em>The exhibition Monet and Boston: Lasting Impression</em>, which opens this week at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston, will <mark>delve</mark> into <mark>the city’s one-time passion</mark> for Monet, <mark>showcasing</mark> all 35 of the institution’s paintings by the artist. Altogether, more than 50 works will <mark>be on view</mark>, including eight more Monets borrowed from private collections and works by artists who influenced the Impressionist, including <mark>woodblock prints</mark> by Hiroshige and paintings by Jean-François Millet and Eugène Boudin. </p>
                <p>A wave of appreciation for Impressionism, and Monet’s paintings in particular, took hold in Boston in the 1890s. Loans were extended to the MFA and the local St Botolph Club, while lectures were offered on <mark>the artist’s oeuvre</mark> and working methods. “Monet was a little worried about so many paintings leaving France for the United States, but he had confidence in Paul Durand-Ruel, who was executing so many of these sales, to do right by him,” Hanson says.</p>
                <p>The Boston exhibition is divided into four <mark>segments</mark> <mark>charting Monet’s beginnings as a painter</mark>, his fascination with Japonisme, his embrace of Normandy, and <mark>the “fairy-tale-like” atmospheric effects</mark> developed in the 1890s. The show, which celebrates the museum’s 150th anniversary, also includes <mark>a piquant rarity</mark>: <mark>a caricature</mark> that Monet drew as a teenager of <mark>a dapper man</mark> holding a cigar and top hat, dating to 1858 and acquired by the MFA in February.</p>

                            alt=:"The painting series Nymphéas (Waterlilies), 1896-1920 by Claude Monet">
                <p>One of Claude Monet’s most celebrated paintings, <em>Water Lilies and Agapanthus (1914-17)</em>, will be shown in the UK for the first time in an exhibition of works at Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London dedicated to the late Abstract Expressionist artist Helen Frankenthaler. </p>
                <p>The Radical Beauty show (15 September-18 April 2022) examines Frankenthaler’s revolutionary approach to the <mark>woodcut</mark>, positioning her as one of <mark>the “medium’s great innovators”</mark>, say the exhibition organisers. The Monet painting, loaned by the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, will go on show alongside Frankenthaler’s 1979 piece <em>Feather</em> which comes from the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation in New York. </p>
                <p>Monet's work <mark>depicts</mark> <mark>the wispy agapanthus plant</mark> that grew along the sides of the pond at his Giverny home. The painting was acquired by the museum in 1966 when Monet's son Michel donated more than 100 canvases by the Impressionist master.</p>
                <p>“Both artists have a shared interest in <mark>pictorial space</mark> and its effect on viewers. Viewing their work is a physical experience and we’re excited that this connection will be drawn out through the display at Dulwich Picture Gallery,” says Marianne Mathieu, <mark>the head curator</mark> at Musée Marmottan Monet, in a statement. </p>
                <p>The links between Abstract Expressionism and Impressionism were explored in a 2018 exhibition, The Water Lilies: American Abstract Painting and the last Monet, at the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris. The show included Helen Frankenthaler’s Riverhead piece (1963) and Monet’s Nymphéas bleus (1916-19). </p>

            <h2>C. ADDITIONAL NOTES </h2>
            <div>
                <p>This week was an exciting week for me. Finally I can actually go back to school and study on campus after almost a year of studying online because of the Covid-19 pandemic. When coming back to school, I met a teacher who taught me in the first year of university. He told me:" Time flies fast, yesterday you guys were just freshmen but now are all final year students", which makes me kinda emotional. </p>
                <p>However, I have a huge amount of workload and many deadlines in this week too. The largest assignment is from Advanced Translation class, the Small Book Project. It's almost midnight now but I still have to complete my assignment.</p>
                <p>Feeling exhausted but I am generally happy got to see my friends this week.</p>
