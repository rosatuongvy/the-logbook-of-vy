        <h3>Medical myths: All about weight loss</h3>
              
        <h4>1. Skipping breakfast aids weight loss</h4>
        <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5842237/pexels-photo-5842237.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt="scale photo">
        <p>The common <mark>adage</mark> that breakfast is the most important meal of the day may or may not be true, but it seems unlikely that skipping the morning meal aids weight loss. The <mark>rationale</mark> behind this strategy is that missing one meal a day leads to a lower overall intake of calories. However, the story is not so <mark>straightforward</mark>.</p>
        <p>One study <em>"Trusted Source"</em>, published in 2010, analyzed food intake information from 2,184 people aged 9–15 years. Twenty years later, the researchers asked for the same information again. They compared data from people who had skipped breakfast during childhood and adulthood with data from those who had never skipped breakfast or had done so only in adulthood. Compared with the other groups, the participants who skipped breakfast during both childhood and adulthood tended to have larger waist circumferences, higher <mark>fasting insulin levels</mark>, and higher total cholesterol levels.</p>
        <p>The scientists found that skipping breakfast had a stronger association with overweight than either alcohol consumption or levels of inactivity.</p>
        
    <h4>2. Weight loss supplements can help</h4>
        <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/612825/pexels-photo-612825.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt="Weight loss supplements photo">
        <p><mark>Proponents</mark> of certain supplements claim that they, too, help the body burn fat. In reality, these are generally ineffective, dangerous, or both. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Trusted Source report that they have “found hundreds of products that are marketed as <mark>dietary</mark> supplements but actually contain hidden active ingredients […] contained in <mark>prescription drugs</mark>, unsafe ingredients in drugs that have been removed from the market, or compounds that have not been <mark>adequately</mark> studied in humans.”</p>
        <p>Jason Humbert, a senior <mark>regulatory manager</mark> at the FDA, adds: “We’ve also found weight loss products marketed as supplements that contain dangerous <mark>concoctions</mark> of hidden ingredients, including active ingredients contained in approved <mark>seizure</mark> medications, blood pressure medications, and <mark>antidepressants</mark>.”</p>
        
    <h4>3. Snack healthily</h4>
        <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1030870/pexels-photo-1030870.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt=" avocado photo">
        <p>People may believe that snacking is <mark>a cardinal sin of dieting</mark>. In some cases, though, snacking can help people manage their <mark>caloric intake</mark> more effectively. </p>
        <p>Having a piece of fruit or some low fat yogurt between meals, for instance, might reduce food <mark>cravings</mark>, keeping a person from overeating at mealtimes or <mark>resorting</mark> to more <mark>energy-dense snacks</mark>.</p>
        
    <h4>4. Some sugars are worse than others</h4>
        <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5842237/pexels-photo-5842237.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt="eat less sugar photo">
        <p>There is a rumor that minimally processed sugars, such as those in maple syrup or honey, are more <mark>healthful</mark> than white sugar. In reality, our bodies process sugar in the same way — regardless of its source. The gut reduces all sugars into <mark>monosaccharides</mark>. </p>

            <h2> Artile Two:</h2>
            <h3><mark>Hypertension</mark> and the <mark>microbiome</mark></h3>
            <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7722837/pexels-photo-7722837.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt="pills photo">
        <p>Blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the wall of <mark>the arteries</mark>. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlight that a person with hypertension is more likely to have a stroke or develop heart disease. An estimated 47% of adults in the U.S. have hypertension, with the condition particularly affecting older adults and females.</p>
        <p>The microbiome is a collection of <mark>microbes</mark> — primarily bacteria — that live in and on a person’s body. Scientists are finding more and more evidence that the microbiome plays a role in maintaining good health.</p>
        <p>There is some evidence that the gut microbiome affects an individual’s risk of hypertension. In the present study, however, the researchers focused on the oral microbiome and its relationship with hypertension risk.</p>
        <p>“Also, we know that oral bacteria can escape from the mouth and <mark>translocate</mark> through the blood circulation to other parts of the body,” Prof. LaMonte explained.</p>
        <img class="thin-border" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6690826/pexels-photo-6690826.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" alt="brushes photo">
        <p><strong>To maintain a healthy oral microbiome</strong>, the ADA recommended that people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>brush their teeth twice per day with a <mark>fluoride</mark> toothpaste</li>
            <li><mark>floss</mark> daily</li>
            <li>eat a healthy diet that limits sugary beverages and snacks</li>
            <li>consult a dentist regularly for prevention and treatment of oral disease</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To determine causation, researchers would need to conduct <mark>a randomized clinical trial</mark>.</p>
        <p>According to Prof. LaMonte, “At present, we are not planning a randomized clinical trial to further evaluate this hypothesis, but such a trial will be critical to know whether or not our results reflect causation or merely association.”</p>

       <h1>c. additional notes</h1>
       <p>This week was not a good week for me. I was exhausted by studying and working. I felt dissapointed about myself due to the fact that I was learning ineffectively and wasting my time.</p>
       <p>Furthermore, terrible timing and prioritizing skills brought me lots of tension as I had stockpile of work needed to be done but I did not know what to do first so I was panicking and crying instead 🤣.</p>
       <p>Anyways, I think these last few weeks are supposed to be stressful as we must complete a number of projects and the intership is coming soon as well. I hope that things will get better next week.</p>
