                <h4><strong>How Some Japanese Architects Have Taken their Offices to the Streets</strong></h4>
                <p>As the <mark>discourse</mark>  about the way we work continues past the original pandemic concern and past <mark> the hybrid</mark> , remote, or what was once called traditional office space; employers and employees alike are still revisiting mental comfort requirements of a post-pandemic worker. While there are many types of work environments and worker needs that have to be addressed separately (besides <mark> the white-collar</mark>  or knowledge worker), from a design and policies front; one particular, newborn model has been popping up in recent years, thus far seen through some unique, <mark> smallscale yet norm challenging Japanese offices</mark> .</p>
                <p>These offices <mark> boast</mark> a few similar <mark> traits</mark> , that are quite unconventional. For one they initially appear as small retail spaces, open and inviting. Their <mark> facades</mark>  are <mark> modular</mark>  and wide as if offering a view into <mark> the inner process of spatial creation</mark> . As opposed to the conventional setup, these spaces embrace the street with the hustle and bustle of the city. </p>
                <p>It isn’t too surprising that most of these <mark> unorthodox offices</mark>  are in fact used by the Architecture practices that designed them. The user/designers have mentioned this conscious choice as a way of reconnecting with the environment they aim to shape. How can one build a city if they’re not familiar with its inner fabric?</p>

                <h3><strong>Article Two:</strong></h3>
                <h4><strong>Bamboo has been used for thousands of years in Asia. Now, it could help solve construction's sustainability problem</strong></h4>
                <p>The construction industry has been heavily criticized in recent years for its environmental impact. The use of materials like steel and concrete are significant contributors to <mark> greenhouse gas emissions</mark> , while the extraction of raw resources including stone, rock and <mark> gravel degrades landscapes</mark>  and soils. This has prompted a search for more <mark> eco-friendly alternatives</mark> .</p>
                <p>Cubo isn't the only company to see the potential of bamboo as a strong, sustainable building material. Vietnamese studio Vo Trong Nghia Architects has used bamboo for many of its projects, including the Casamia Community House in the Casamia Resort in Hoi An, while Shenzhen-based Zuo Studio created <mark> bamboo pavilions</mark>  for the Taichung Flora Exposition in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>The Philippines is currently facing a severe housing shortage, with an estimated 4.5 million people living homeless in 2021, and <mark> a deficit of affordable homes</mark> .</p>
                <p>Cubo's homes cost between 649,800 Philippine pesos ($12,900) to 1.8 million Philippine pesos ($35,738) -- which is roughly comparable to mid-range homes built with <mark> conventional materials</mark> , says Forlales. However, he aims to bring prices down by <mark> streamlining</mark>  production and increasing automation in the workshop. The company has also introduced a payment plan, to help reduce <mark> upfront costs</mark>  for buyers.</p>
