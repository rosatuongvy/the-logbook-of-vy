                <h4>The Benefits Of Deep Breathing And Meditation For Diabetics</h4>
                <p>The <mark>prevalence</mark> of diabetes is rising rapidly all over the world and even in India. Indeed, <mark>type-2 diabetes</mark> is now reaching <mark>epidemic</mark> proportions. It is known that poor lifestyle contributes to the rise of <mark>non-communicable diseases</mark> (NCDs) like diabetes, <mark>hypertension</mark> and heart disease. Conversely, modifying one's lifestyle can help to reduce the burden of these non-communicable diseases in general and diabetes in particular.</p>
                <p>Stress, anxiety and depression are well known to be associated with diabetes. Indeed, depression has a bidirectional relation with diabetes. Thus, depression can produce diabetes and diabetes can produce depression. It is here that the role of yoga, pranayama and meditation plays a big role. There are specific yoga sanas which are believed to help to control and to prevent diabetes. Deep breathing and meditation are also very useful but less studied in relation to diabetes control.</p>
                <p>If you devote just 10 - 15 minutes a day to practice deep breathing, you will find <mark>beneficial effects</mark>, not only in controlling diabetes, but also in reducing blood pressure and preventing heart disease. Moreover, you will find that you are less <mark>excitable</mark>, calm and stress free. Hence, on the occasion of International Yoga Day, everyone with diabetes should practice pranayama and deep breathing and make it a part of their daily living. You should try it and see the beneficial effects, both on your body and your mind.</p>
