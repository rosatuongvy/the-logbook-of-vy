                <h4>Stay Fit During The Festive Season?: Yoga And A Healthy Diet Is The Key</h4>
                <p>Festivals are special occasions where we get to savour all the good things of life whole-heartedly. It would not do if you began depriving yourself of your favourite sweets and other festive treats. Instead, play it smart by including yoga practices of asanas, pranayama and meditation in your regular routine. Yoga is a wonderful tool for the well-being of your mind, body and spirit. </p>
                <p>Make sure that you supplement your heavy festival meals with vitamins, minerals, proteins and carbohydrates. A good way to enjoy all the treats that come your way is by exercising moderation. Do not go overboard with the indulgence, but neither should you deprive yourself. Consume items which provide you with bodily strength mental happiness. Drink plenty of water and leave a gap of at least 3-4 hours between meals and keep snacking to a minimum.</p>
                <p>Festivals can feel pretty taxing for your mental health as you get caught up in a flurry of activities with no quiet time for yourself. Meditation techniques can be simple and very useful in calming the mind and soothing jangled nerves. You can start your day with a few minutes of meditation and sit for a few quiet moments. Meditation Techniques like Bhavigatha Dhyan and Aarambh Dhyan are easy and great whether you are a beginner or have meditated before. You can also include breathing exercises such as Kapal Bhati, Anulom Vilom or Khand Pranayama to meditate on your breath.</p>
                <p>To truly celebrate the spirit of the festivities, you cannot spend most of your time counting the calories.

                <h4>The Benefits Of Deep Breathing And Meditation For Diabetics</h4>
                <p>The prevalence of diabetes is rising rapidly all over the world and even in India. Indeed, type-2 diabetes is now reaching epidemic proportions. It is known that poor lifestyle contributes to the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Conversely, modifying one's lifestyle can help to reduce the burden of these non-communicable diseases in general and diabetes in particular.</p>
                <p>The effect of healthy diet with reduced carbohydrate intake and increased intake of green leafy vegetables, plant, protein and healthy fats and the role of physical activity in prevention and control of diabetes are well established. However, the effect of other lifestyle modifications, particularly, yoga, pranayama and meditation are less well known. At least in a subset of people with type-2 diabetes, stress plays a very important role in its causation and also in making the diabetes go out of control in those with already established diabetes. There is also a separate entity called 'stress induced diabetes'.</p>
                <p>Stress, anxiety and depression are well known to be associated with diabetes. Indeed, depression has a bidirectional relation with diabetes. Thus, depression can produce diabetes and diabetes can produce depression. It is here that the role of yoga, pranayama and meditation plays a big role. There are specific yoga sanas which are believed to help to control and to prevent diabetes. Deep breathing and meditation are also very useful but less studied in relation to diabetes control.</p>
                <p>if you devote just 10 - 15 minutes a day to practice deep breathing, you will find beneficial effects, not only in controlling diabetes, but also in reducing blood pressure and preventing heart disease. Moreover, you will find that you are less excitable, calm and stress free. Hence, on the occasion of International Yoga Day, everyone with diabetes should practice pranayama and deep breathing and make it a part of their daily living. You should try it and see the beneficial effects, both on your body and your mind.</p>

              <h2>ADDITIONAL NOTES</h2>
              <p>This week is the last week I study at school. It's hard to believe that I will be graduated soon and literally no longer be a student anymore. It's a bit sad to think about but also happy because I finally can go to work.</p>
              <p>Thank you for teaching us, giving us lots of useful knowledge about interpretation with lively lessons and exchange times with foreigners. I had good time studying in your class. </p>
              <p>I hope you have a cheerful week and stay healthy.</p>
